# Vercel Image Loading Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis
Your website at https://www.swagatodisha.com/ is experiencing 404 errors for images because of a deployment configuration mismatch.

### Current Issues:
1. **404 errors for images**: `slider1.jpg`, `chairman.jpg`, `Swagat Favicon.png`, etc.
2. **Deployment configuration mismatch**: Vercel root directory vs. build output directory
3. **Image path resolution**: Absolute paths not being served correctly

## Root Cause
The problem is in your Vercel deployment configuration:
- **Vercel root directory**: Set to `frontend` 
- **Build output**: `frontend/dist`
- **Image references**: Using absolute paths like `/slider1.jpg`

This creates a mismatch where Vercel looks for images in the wrong location.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update Vercel Configuration
Your `vercel.json` has been updated to:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/dist",
  "installCommand": "cd frontend && npm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|ico|webp))",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Verify Build Process
The build process is working correctly:
- Images are being copied to `frontend/dist/`
- All slider images, logos, and other assets are present
- Build completes successfully without errors

### 3. Deployment Steps
1. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel image loading configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - Ensure the build completes successfully

3. **Verify image paths**:
   - Check that images load correctly
   - Verify no more 404 errors in browser console

## Alternative Solutions (if the above doesn't work)

### Option 1: Change Vercel Root Directory
In your Vercel project settings:
- Set the root directory to the project root (not `frontend`)
- Update `vercel.json` to use `"outputDirectory": "frontend/dist"`

### Option 2: Update Image Paths
If the deployment issue persists, we can update image references to use relative paths instead of absolute paths.

### Option 3: Use Vercel's Image Optimization
Implement Vercel's built-in image optimization for better performance.

## Current Status
✅ **Build process**: Working correctly  
✅ **Image assets**: Present in dist folder  
✅ **Configuration**: Updated  
⏳ **Deployment**: Needs to be tested  

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated configuration
2. Test image loading on the live site
3. Monitor for any remaining 404 errors
4. Report back if issues persist
