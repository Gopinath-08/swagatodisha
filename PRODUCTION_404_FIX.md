# Production 404 Error Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis
The 404 error on `https://www.swagatodisha.com/login` occurs because:

1. **Client-Side Routing Issue**: React Router handles `/login` as a client-side route
2. **Vercel Configuration**: The rewrite rules weren't properly configured for SPA routing
3. **Missing Route Handling**: Vercel couldn't find a physical `/login` file and wasn't redirecting to `index.html`

## Root Cause
- When users visit `https://www.swagatodisha.com/login`, Vercel looks for a physical file
- Since it's a React SPA route, no physical file exists
- The original `vercel.json` rewrite rule wasn't working correctly
- This caused 404 errors and 30-second timeouts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated vercel.json
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/((?!api/).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Changed from `"source": "/(.*)"` to `"source": "/((?!api/).*)"`
- This excludes API routes from being rewritten to index.html
- Ensures all frontend routes (including `/login`) are handled by React Router

### 2. Added CORS Configuration
Updated `backend/server.js` to include production domains:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || [
        'http://localhost:3000', 
        'http://localhost:5173', 
        'https://www.swagatodisha.com', 
        'https://swagatodisha.com'
    ],
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With']
}));
```

### 3. Added Backup _redirects File
Created `frontend/public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Use Updated vercel.json (Recommended)
1. The updated `vercel.json` is already in place
2. Deploy to Vercel - it should automatically use the new configuration
3. Test the `/login` route

### Option 2: Use Alternative Configuration
If the first option doesn't work:
1. Replace `vercel.json` with `vercel-alternative.json`
2. Rename `vercel-alternative.json` to `vercel.json`
3. Deploy to Vercel

### Option 3: Manual Vercel Configuration
If both JSON files fail:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Functions
2. Add a rewrite rule:
   - Source: `/((?!api/).*)`
   - Destination: `/index.html`

## Testing Steps

1. **Deploy the changes to Vercel**
2. **Test these URLs:**
   - `https://www.swagatodisha.com/` (should work)
   - `https://www.swagatodisha.com/login` (should work now)
   - `https://www.swagatodisha.com/register` (should work)
   - `https://www.swagatodisha.com/dashboard/student` (should work)
   - `https://www.swagatodisha.com/about` (should work)

3. **Check Network Tab:**
   - No more 404 errors
   - No more 30-second timeouts
   - All routes should load the React app

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `FRONTEND_URL=https://www.swagatodisha.com`

### 2. Backend Deployment
Make sure your backend is deployed and accessible at:
- `https://swagat-odisha-backend.onrender.com`

### 3. Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
- Vercel function logs
- Backend API logs
- User reports of 404 errors

## Troubleshooting

### If 404 errors persist:
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify the rewrite rules are active
3. Try clearing browser cache
4. Test in incognito mode

### If API calls fail:
1. Check CORS configuration
2. Verify backend is running
3. Check network requests in browser dev tools

### If routes still don't work:
1. Use the alternative `vercel.json` configuration
2. Add explicit route rewrites for each route
3. Contact Vercel support if needed

## Files Modified
- `vercel.json` - Updated rewrite rules
- `backend/server.js` - Added production CORS origins
- `frontend/public/_redirects` - Added backup redirect rules
- `vercel-alternative.json` - Created alternative configuration

## Expected Result
After implementing these fixes:
- ✅ All routes should work without 404 errors
- ✅ No more 30-second timeouts
- ✅ React Router should handle all client-side routing
- ✅ API calls should work properly
- ✅ Login and registration should function correctly
