# SOLUTION: Remove .vercelignore completely

The issue is that Vercel is finding a .vercelignore file (possibly cached) that's removing the src/ directory and other essential files needed for the build.

## Quick Fix:

1. **Delete any .vercelignore files**:
   ```bash
   # Remove from root
   rm .vercelignore
   
   # Remove from frontend
   rm frontend/.vercelignore
   ```

2. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove .vercelignore files to prevent build issues"
   git push
   ```

3. **Redeploy on Vercel**

## Why This Works:

- ✅ No .vercelignore = No file removal
- ✅ All source files preserved
- ✅ Build can access src/ directory
- ✅ Vite can find main.jsx

## Alternative: Create Empty .vercelignore

If you need .vercelignore for some reason, create an empty one:
```bash
touch .vercelignore
# Leave it empty - this prevents Vercel from removing files
```

The deployment should work perfectly after removing the .vercelignore files!
