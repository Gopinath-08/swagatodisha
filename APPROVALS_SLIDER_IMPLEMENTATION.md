# Approvals and Recognitions Slider Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive slider-based Approvals and Recognitions section for the Swagat Odisha website. This new system replaces the static approvals section with an interactive slider that showcases multiple universities and their respective approvals.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **University Slider**
- **8 Universities** displayed in a rotating carousel:
  - Kalinga University (8 approvals)
  - Utkal University (7 approvals)
  - Sikkim Alpine University (8 approvals)
  - Sikkim Professional University (8 approvals)
  - Sikkim Skill University (6 approvals)
  - Asian International University (8 approvals)
  - MATS University (7 approvals)
  - Capital University (8 approvals)

### 2. **Interactive Slider Controls**
- **Auto-advance**: Slides change automatically every 5 seconds
- **Navigation arrows**: Left/right arrows for manual navigation
- **Slide indicators**: Clickable dots to jump to specific slides
- **Slide counter**: Shows current slide position (e.g., "3 of 8")

### 3. **Approval Logos with PDF Download**
- **8 Approval Types** with clickable logos:
  - UGC (University Grants Commission)
  - AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education)
  - Bar Council of India
  - Pharmacy Council of India
  - RCI (Rehabilitation Council of India)
  - Sikkim Nursing Council
  - Association of Indian Universities (AIU)
  - Government Approval

- **PDF Download Functionality**: Clicking any approval logo downloads the corresponding PDF document
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same approval logo downloads the same PDF across all universities

### 4. **Visual Design**
- **Gradient Background**: Green-to-orange gradient matching the design requirements
- **SAU Logo**: Subtle background logo as requested
- **Top Arrow**: Downward arrow at the top of the section
- **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur and transparency
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

### 5. **Technical Implementation**
- **React Hooks**: Uses useState and useEffect for state management
- **Auto-slide Timer**: 5-second interval with cleanup on component unmount
- **Event Handlers**: Click handlers for navigation and PDF downloads
- **Dynamic Content**: Content changes based on current slide state

## File Structure
